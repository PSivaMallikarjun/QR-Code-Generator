# QR-Code-Generator
"This is a simple QR Code Generator web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input text or a URL and generates a corresponding QR code using the QRCode.js library. The app provides an easy and visually appealing way to create QR codes directly in the browser."

How it works:
HTML provides a basic form with an input field for entering text or URLs and a button to generate the QR code.
CSS styles the page, ensuring the form is centered and visually appealing.
JavaScript uses the QRCode.js library to generate the QR code. When the user inputs text and clicks the button, the generateQRCode() function is triggered, creating the QR code and displaying it in the specified div.
Steps to use:
Save the code in three separate files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Open the index.html file in a browser.
Enter some text or a URL in the input field and click the "Generate QR Code" button to generate the QR code.
Libraries Used:
The QRCode.js library is included from a CDN link to generate the QR code. You can replace this with a local version if you prefer.
This is a simple and functional QR Code generator web app. You can further customize it or add features such as the ability to download the generated QR code.
